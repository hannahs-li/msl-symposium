## United in Science, Divided by Trust: Pandemic Lessons from the United States and Canada

This topic initially started as a cross comparison between the United States and Canada in their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. A noticeable difference in trust and pandemic outcomes between the two countries led to the creation of a comprehensive dataset and machine learning model attaching statistical significance to the impact of public trust in national government on Covid-19 mortality rates.
